  <!--    Gitlab is a company which develops software used by an active community of members. It openly shares information amongst it's members through forum and active participation in projects. They have a need to use Vue.js Framework on their forum boards and have chosen Vue for a few simple reasons. Vue improves performance during page load times by not blocking the page with heavy items and loading thereafter. They have also found Vue to be very easy to use as the code is very readable and documentation straight forward. It also does not require external libraries or plug-ins and can be used with or without jQuery. In a nut shell, Vue gives Gitlab the ability to write less code and avoid the bottleneck of not loading user comments asynchronously. -->
